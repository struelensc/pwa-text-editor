## Description

This project was to build a text editor that runs in the browser as a single-page application while also meeting the progressive web application criteria. This project also features several data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one is not supported by the browser. This application is also able to function offline.

This app uses:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- IndexedDB
- idb.js for a wrapper of the IndexedDB API
- Webpack and html-webpack-plugin
- webpack-pwa-manifest
- workbox-webpack-plugin
